{"name":"Nathan Vos","tagline":"Statistician and Data Scientist","body":"###A little about me\r\n\r\nI enjoy creating, learning, laughing, and asking questions. I'm fascinated by the unlimited potential of data today and am passionate about discovering new data-driven insights through the use of machine learning tools and proper statistical techniques. I'm looking forward to solving complex problems for a company keen on making well-informed decisions from big data.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm not poring over data, you can probably find me cheering on the [Dolphins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIcIPd9bDBI), listening to RHCP or Cake, trying to improve my jumper (I'm **definitely** no Steph Curry), savoring a hoppy IPA (highly recommended: Zombie Dust and IBUsive), or wolfing down a burrito. My pipe dream is to found a racing league for a water slide analogue of the luge (perfect for the summer Olympics!) and my current more attainable goal is learning the guitar.\r\n\r\n###Projects","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
