{"name":"Nathan Vos","tagline":"Statistician and Data Scientist","body":"###About Me\r\nI enjoy creating, learning, connecting, and asking questions. I'm fascinated by the unlimited potential of data today and am passionate about discovering new data-driven insights through the use of machine learning tools and proper statistical techniques. I'm looking forward to solving complex problems for a company keen on making well-informed decisions from big data.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm not poring over data, you can probably find me cheering on the [Dolphins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIcIPd9bDBI), listening to RHCP or Cake, trying to improve my jumper (I'm **definitely** no Steph Curry), savoring a hoppy IPA (highly recommended: Zombie Dust and IBUsive), or wolfing down a burrito. My pipe dream is to create a water slide racing league (similar to the luge, perfect for the summer Olympics!) and my current, more attainable goal is learning to play the guitar beyond Smoke on the Water.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n###Projects\r\nI'll be posting projects I've worked on and am working on from time to time on my github, but I'll also summarize a couple interesting ones here.\r\n\r\n####Correlation in Fantasy Football (Master's Thesis)\r\n- Obtained game data from 2009-14 from nfl.com using Andrew Gallant's nflgame API and formatted it for analysis in R\r\n\r\n- Developed basic parametric assumptions concerning the estimation of fantasy point correlations of NFL players by position, which allowed for inference on these correlations\r\n\r\n- Analyzed and demonstrated how the results can be utilized in both season-long and weekly fantasy leagues\r\n\r\n####Classifying Handwritten Digits \r\n- Implemented a number of algorithms in both R and Python to classify digits in the MNIST handwritten digits data set\r\n\r\n- Algorithms included: PCA, k-means, Fisher's discriminant analysis, logistic regression, SGD, SVM, and mixture models (via the EM algorithm)\r\n\r\n- Achieved 9 % test error rate using SVM and 11 % using logistic regression\r\n\r\n####Binary Star System Classification\r\n- Analyzed 24 GB of Hubble Telescope light flux data for over 150,000 star systems using PySpark\r\n\r\n- Fit a non-parametric regression to each star system's light curve using Gaussian and Epanechnikov kernels (bandwidth selected via LOOCV) to produce residual light readings\r\n\r\n- Identified potential binary star systems by detecting systematic trends in the residual light readings \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
